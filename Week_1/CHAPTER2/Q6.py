# TODO:
# Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome. 

# Singly: 1) Reverse the list, see if it's equal, 2) Iterate through and append values to list, see if it's a palindrome 

# Doubly: 1) Iterate from the front and back (._first and ._last) and check if theyre equal
